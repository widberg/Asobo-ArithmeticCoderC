# Asobo ArithmeticCoderC

A reference implementation of Asobo Studio's Arithmetic Coder.

<sup>This repository is a relative of the main [FMTK repository](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk).</sup>

## Background

This repository contains a modification of the Arithmetic Coder in "Arithmetic Coding revealed - A guided tour from theory to praxis" that matches the one found in the game FUEL by Asobo Studio. The necessary modifications were discovered through reverse engineering the game. The FMTK Wiki entry [Asobo Arithmetic Coding Compression](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk/wiki/Asobo-Arithmetic-Coding-Compression) contains more information.
